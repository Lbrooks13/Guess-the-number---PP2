# Guess the Number

Guess the number is a fun guessing game where you try to out-smart the computer. The computer will randomly pick a number between 1 and 100 and it's your job to guess what it's thinking. Don;t worry! It'll help you along the way with hints, and if you're successful you can log your score!

## Features -
- Number Input - Here the user can input their guess. The app will then log this and move onto the next feature.
- Hints - The game will log which num,bers you have entered to prevent you from using up a try on an already used number.

- Remaining Guesses - The game counts down how many remains tries you have.
- Duplicate Numbers - The game keeps track of which numbers you have used (as mentioned above) but will also not allow you to enter a duplicate number. If this happens, a pop-up will warn you and the game will not deduct a try from you.
- Your Score - When you correctly guess the number, the game will log the score for you on the leader-board.

## Testing -
When going through the testing phase I wanted to ensure the user journey was straightforward, with the user being able to easily use the app and feel that the game responds correctly and efficiently.

It was essential that the platform was fully responsive so users are able to easily use the application as intended, on any device. The simplistic user interface is fully responsive across Desktop, Laptop and Mobile.

All information either required or displayed to the user is clear and concise. This allows a variety of people to use the app, regardless of skill level with technology or ability.
